## Business ID (Business Identity Code)

The Business ID, also known as the Business Identity Code, is a crucial identifier assigned to businesses and organizations by either the PRH or the Tax Administration. Comprising seven digits, a dash, and a control mark (e.g., 1234567-8), this code plays a pivotal role in business identification.

It's important to note that while the Business ID uniquely identifies a business, it doesn't provide information about whether the business is registered with the Tax Administration registers or the Trade Register. For specific details on registration status, it's advisable to conduct a thorough check through the BIS search, the PRH, or the Tax Administration.

Furthermore, companies listed in the Trade Register, VAT Register, Prepayment Register, or Employer Register are required to prominently display their Business ID on various documents, including invoices, business letters, and forms. This ensures transparency and compliance with regulatory standards. If you're looking for information on VAT registration, consider performing a thorough search using relevant keywords such as "vat number verification," "find vat number," or "vat number lookup" for comprehensive results.
